OpenIntro Labs promote the understanding and application of statistics through  applied data analysis.
Labs are titled based on topic area, which correspond to  particular chapters in all three versions of OpenIntro Statistics, a free and  open-source textbook.
The textbook as well as the html version of the labs can be found at [http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php](http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php).

This repository is a fork of the original base-R labs.
It incorporates the tidyverse syntax from the `dplyr` package for data manipulation, the `ggplot2` package for graphics, and the `infer` package for statistical inference.

## Source code for labs

We currently support our source files in the RMarkdown (.Rmd) format, which can be output into html format (though output to pdf is also possible).
The source files are processed using the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package in R, and are easiest to use in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

## Feedback / collaboration

Your feedback is most welcomed! If you have suggestions for minor updates (fixing typos, etc.) please do not hesitate to issue a pull request.
If you have ideas for major revamp of a lab (replacing outdated code with modern version, overhaul in  pedagogy, etc.) please create an issue so to start the conversation.

It is our hope that these materials are useful for instructors and students of  statistics.
If you end up developing some interesting variants of these labs or  creating new ones, please let us know!
